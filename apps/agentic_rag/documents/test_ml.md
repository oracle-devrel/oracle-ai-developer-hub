# Test Document

This is a test document about machine learning.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Key concepts include:

1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error

Neural networks are a popular machine learning architecture inspired by the human brain.
