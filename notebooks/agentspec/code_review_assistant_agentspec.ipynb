    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s fast-paced development environment, code reviews are crucial but can be time-consuming. This tutorial is designed for individuals and teams who want to leverage the power of AI agents to automate the review of pull requests. Whether you’re working on open-source projects or enterprise software, integrating AI-powered code review tools can save time, reduce errors, and ensure coding standards are consistently enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this guide is to walk you through the process of building a **Code Review Assistant** using Agent Spec, a framework-agnostic specification for portable AI agents and MCP (Model Context Protocol), which enables seamless interaction with tools and external systems. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a functional assistant capable of analyzing code changes and providing detailed feedback with actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll also discover how to export and reuse your assistant across multiple compatible agentic frameworks, giving you ultimate flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Agent Spec?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent Spec** is a framework-agnostic declarative specification designed to make AI agents and workflows portable, reusable, and executable across any compatible framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent Spec** addresses the ongoing challenge of fragmentation in AI agent development, where different frameworks like AutoGen, LangGraph, and CrewAI lack a shared foundation, hindering portability and reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent Spec** enables developers to define AI agents and workflows that can be easily run, maintained, and adapted across various platforms and runtimes without rewriting code. This standardization benefits enterprises by streamlining scalability, reducing platform lock-in, simplifying maintenance, and enabling seamless collaboration both internally and with external partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more about the Agent Spec motivation and vision at https://oracle.github.io/agent-spec/agentspec/intro_and_motivation.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you can read the full Agent Spec documentation at https://oracle.github.io/agent-spec/\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use WayFlow (see https://github.com/oracle/wayflow) and LangGraph (see https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) as the runtimes in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Overview: What we are building\n",
    "\n",
    "![image2](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:600/format:webp/1*nXUzkrS2bcp144EEwZPx_g.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are building a Code Assistant specifically designed for reviewing GitHub pull requests. The assistant will be equipped with tools to interact with GitHub, analyze code changes, and provide detailed feedback to improve code quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools to connect with GitHub, allowing it to list pull requests, read their contents, and retrieve file details for comprehensive reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image4](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:600/format:webp/1*P4n7o5dOCXU4TdJuTQ10Xg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) is a standardized framework that streamlines communication between AI agents and external systems through a consistent and secure interface. It provides a suite of tools and protocols for agents to perform various tasks, access multiple data sources, and integrate with different platforms seamlessly. \n",
    "\n",
    "By simplifying the process of connecting with disparate systems, MCP allows developers to focus on building core agent functionality without getting bogged down by the details of each integration. This results in greater flexibility and scalability for AI-based solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1. Setting up the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's create and activate a virtual environment (outside of this Notebook):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create and activate a virtual environment (run in your terminal)\n",
    "python -m venv venv-agentspec \n",
    "source venv-agentspec/bin/activate # On Windows: venv-agentspec\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let’s install pyagentspec, wayflowcore which are the packages we need to run this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install \"pyagentspec[langgraph_mcp]@git+https://github.com/oracle/agent-spec@main#subdirectory=pyagentspec\"\n",
    "pip install \"wayflowcore@git+https://github.com/oracle/wayflow@main#subdirectory=wayflowcore\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also clone the repositories to stay up to date with the latest features ([agent-spec](https://github.com/oracle/agent-spec), [wayflow](https://github.com/oracle/wayflow)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2. Configuring your LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "WayFlow supports several LLM API providers. For an overview of supported LLMs, see the guide [How to Use LLMs from Different Providers](https://oracle.github.io/wayflow/core/howtoguides/llm_from_different_providers.html).\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "This will provide comprehensive logs to help identify issues. Below are some common errors and their potential causes or solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Incorrect MCP Server URL:** If the URL to the MCP server is wrong, you will see a log entry indicating “HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found” for the specified URL. Double-check the server URL in your StreamableHTTPTransport configuration and ensure it matches the documented endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Invalid Personal Access Token (PAT):** An error like “Client error ‘400 Bad Request’ for url ‘https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp'” typically indicates an incorrect PAT or insufficient permissions. Verify that your GitHub PAT is correct and has the necessary scopes and permissions. Regenerate a new token if needed at https://github.com/settings/tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Incorrect Tool Name in Toolbox:** If a tool name specified in the MCPToolBox is wrong, you will encounter a `NoSuchToolFoundOnMCPServerError` in WayFlow. Review the tool names in your `tool_filter` list against the MCP server documentation (e.g., GitHub MCP server docs) to ensure they match exactly (e.g., `list_pull_requests`, not `list_prs`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **LLM Configuration Issues:** If your LLM fails to initialize, you might see errors related to invalid model IDs, API keys, or connection issues. For instance, with Ollama, a “ConnectionRefused” error indicates the local server URL might be incorrect or the server is not running. Verify your llm_config settings and ensure the model provider’s service is accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter an error not listed here, consult the debug logs for detailed stack traces and search for relevant error codes in the Agent Spec, WayFlow, or LangGraph documentation. Community forums and GitHub issues for these projects can also provide additional troubleshooting insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Going Further\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you’ve built a basic Code Review Assistant, there are several ways to enhance its capabilities. Here are some concise suggestions to take your agent further:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enable Commenting on Pull Requests:** Extend your agent to post comments on GitHub by adding the `pull_request_review_write` tool to your `MCPToolBox`. Update instructions to include posting inline feedback, integrating reviews into the development workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Summarize Code Changes:** Add a workflow step to summarize code diffs before detailed review to manage context length. Process diffs from `pull_request_read` to create concise summaries for the agent to reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Support Multiple Repositories:** Enable handling of pull requests across multiple repositories. Adjust instructions to switch contexts based on user queries, possibly using dynamic tool setups or additional MCP tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add Custom Review Criteria:** Tailor reviews with project-specific criteria by updating the system prompt with guidelines for patterns, naming, or performance. This ensures feedback matches team and project standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "These enhancements can greatly improve your Code Review Assistant’s functionality. Experiment with these ideas to adapt the agent to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitHub Repository\n",

    "You can access all the code used in this article on the [AgentSpec GitHub](https://github.com/oracle/agent-spec/blob/main/docs/pyagentspec/source/code_examples/ext_code_assistant_tutorial.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, you learned how to build a simple yet powerful Code Assistant Agent for GitHub pull request reviews by equipping an Agent with MCP tools using Agent Spec and ran it with Wayflow and LangGraph."
