# Spraay Protocol — Payment-Enabled AI Agents

## About Spraay

[Spraay Protocol](https://spraay.app) is a multi-chain batch payment protocol deployed across **15 blockchains** and an [x402](https://www.x402.org) payment gateway with **88 pay-per-call endpoints** across **19 categories**. The [Spraay x402 Gateway](https://gateway.spraay.app) enables AI agents to pay for premium services — inference (200+ models), Bittensor decentralized AI, search/RAG, compute, storage, robotics, and more — using USDC micropayments over standard HTTP. No API keys required.

Spraay's batch payment tool is an official community tool in [Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://github.com/google/adk-python-community) — merged as PR #95.
